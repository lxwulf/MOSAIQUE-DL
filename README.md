# MOSAIQUE-DL

A little Fun-Project for myself for learning Python

## Why?

I wanted those Wallpapers and animated profile pictures, but also didn't
want to download all by myself so thought about to write a script. At
the first seconds I joked with myself, but then I thought "Why not?".

## Conclusion

It was completely profitable! I learned alot about Python and also of
course about Selenium. I think I would one or another Project in this
direction.

## Technician Documentation

### Required

- Python 3.9.5 (at least)
